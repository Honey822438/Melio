## M0 — Project Setup ✅

**Goal:** Working Express + TypeScript server connected to Supabase

### What Was Built

- Express server running on port 5000
- TypeScript configured (strict mode, no any)
- Supabase client setup with two clients: `supabase` (anon key) and `supabaseAdmin` (service role key, bypasses RLS)
- Health check endpoint `GET /api/health`
- Environment variables structure defined
- All core TypeScript interfaces defined upfront

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `server.ts` | Entry point — Express app, middleware, route mounting, port 5000 |
| `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript config — strict mode on, noUnusedLocals, noImplicitReturns |
| `.env.example` | Placeholder env vars (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, JWT_SECRET, PORT, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD, FRONTEND_URL) |
| `src/config/supabase.ts` | Two Supabase clients — anon (RLS-respecting) and admin (service role, server-only) |
| `src/types/index.ts` | Core interfaces: User, SellerProfile, Product, ProductImage, Category, CartItem, Order, OrderItem, OrderStatus, PaymentMethod, AddressSnapshot, Review, ApiResponse<T>, PaginatedResponse<T>, JwtPayload |

### Endpoints

| Method | Route | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/health` | None | Server health check — returns uptime |

---

## M1 — Authentication System ✅

**Goal:** Complete auth for Buyer, Seller, Admin roles with JWT

### What Was Built

- Separate signup flows for Buyer and Seller
- JWT-based authentication (login returns signed token)
- Role-based middleware: `verifyToken`, `requireRole(...roles)`, `isApprovedSeller`
- Seller approval system — Admin must set `is_verified = true` before seller can list products
- Admin account seeded via one-time script
- Supabase migration for users table with RLS bypass via service role key

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/middleware/auth.ts` | `verifyToken`, `requireRole(...roles)`, `isApprovedSeller` middleware |
| `src/services/auth.service.ts` | DB logic — registerBuyer, registerSeller, loginUser, getUserById, updateUserProfile |
| `src/controllers/auth.controller.ts` | Request/response handling + input validation for all auth endpoints |
| `src/routes/auth.routes.ts` | Route definitions mounted at `/api/auth` |
| `src/db/migrations/001_create_users.sql` | Creates users table: id, name, email, password_hash, role, city, province, shop_name, shop_bio, logo_url, is_verified, created_at |
| `src/db/seeds/seed-admin.ts` | One-time script to seed admin account — reads ADMIN_EMAIL/ADMIN_PASSWORD from .env |

### Endpoints

| Method | Route | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register/buyer` | None | Register new buyer |
| POST | `/api/auth/register/seller` | None | Register new seller (pending admin approval) |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | None | Login — returns JWT token + user object |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | None | Logout (stateless — client drops token) |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | verifyToken | Get current user profile |
| PUT | `/api/auth/profile` | verifyToken | Update name, city, province, shop fields |

### Key Rules Implemented

- Passwords hashed with bcryptjs (12 salt rounds)
- JWT payload contains: `userId`, `email`, `role`, `is_verified`
- Seller gets token on registration but `isApprovedSeller` middleware blocks protected routes until `is_verified = true`
- Admin seeded manually — no public admin registration endpoint
- All DB queries use `supabaseAdmin` (service role) to bypass RLS

## M2 — Product Management ✅

**Goal:** Sellers can list products with images. Everyone can browse.

### What Was Built

- Full product CRUD for sellers (own products only — ownership verified in service layer)
- Multiple image upload (up to 5 images, 5MB each) via Multer memory storage → Supabase Storage
- Images stored in `product-images` bucket, URLs saved to `product_images` table
- Category system with 6 default categories seeded in migration
- Admin can moderate all products and manage categories
- Delete product cascade — images deleted from Storage before DB row removed

### Files Created

## M3 — Search & Discovery ✅

**Goal:** Buyers can find products via full-text search, filters, and sorting

### What Was Built

- Full-text search using PostgreSQL `tsvector` — generated column `search_vector` on products table combining title + description
- GIN index on `search_vector` for fast queries
- Prefix matching (partial word search supported — "lah" matches "Lahori")
- Filter by category, city, province, price range, is_handmade
- Sort by newest, price_asc, price_desc, top_rated, relevance
- Only in-stock products returned (stock > 0)
- Autocomplete suggestions endpoint (min 2 chars, returns up to 5 titles)
- Trending products (top rated) for homepage
- New arrivals (most recent) for homepage
- Products by city for homepage "local picks" section

| GET | `/api/search/new-arrivals` | None | Most recently added (homepage) |
| GET | `/api/search/by-city?city=Multan` | None | Products from a specific city |

### Query Params for GET /api/search

`q`, `category_id`, `city`, `province`, `min_price`, `max_price`, `is_handmade`, `sort` (newest/price_asc/price_desc/top_rated/relevance), `page`, `limit` (max 50)

## M4 — Cart & Checkout ✅

**Goal:** Buyers can manage a cart and place orders with stock management

### What Was Built

- Full cart CRUD: add, view, update quantity, remove item, clear cart
- Upsert logic on add — if item already in cart, quantity increments
- Stock validation on every add/update
- Sellers cannot add their own products to cart
- Order placement: fetches cart → validates stock → creates order + items → decrements stock → clears cart
- Address snapshot saved as JSONB at time of order (never affected by future address changes)
- Price locked at purchase time (`price_at_purchase` on order items)
- Buyer can cancel order while status is `pending` — stock is restored
- Seller can update order status through the progression: `pending → processing → shipped → delivered`
- Status regression blocked (cannot move backwards)
- Admin can view all orders, optionally filtered by status

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/services/cart.service.ts` | getCart, addToCart (upsert), updateCartQuantity, removeFromCart, clearCart |
| `src/services/order.service.ts` | placeOrder, getOrderById, getBuyerOrders, getSellerOrders, updateOrderStatus, cancelOrder |

| `src/controllers/order.controller.ts` | Request/response handling for all order endpoints |
| `src/routes/cart.routes.ts` | Cart routes mounted at `/api/cart` — buyer only |
| `src/routes/order.routes.ts` | Order routes mounted at `/api/orders` — buyer only |
| `src/db/migrations/005_create_cart_orders.sql` | Creates cart_items (UNIQUE buyer+product), orders (with JSONB address snapshot), order_items tables |

### Endpoints

| Method | Route | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/cart` | buyer | Get cart with product details + total |
| POST | `/api/cart` | buyer | Add item (or increment quantity if exists) |
| PUT | `/api/cart/:itemId` | buyer | Update item quantity |
| DELETE | `/api/cart/:itemId` | buyer | Remove item |
| DELETE | `/api/cart` | buyer | Clear entire cart |
| POST | `/api/orders` | buyer | Place order from cart |

| PUT | `/api/seller/orders/:id/status` | isApprovedSeller | Update order status |
| GET | `/api/admin/orders` | isAdmin | Get all orders (filterable by status) |

### Key Rules Implemented

- Stock decremented atomically per item on order placement
- Stock restored if buyer cancels
- `price_at_purchase` locked at order time — price changes don't affect existing orders
- `address_snapshot` JSONB — delivery address frozen at order time
- Sellers only see orders that contain their own items
- Status progression enforced: cannot go backwards, only forwards
